Blur images in the WordPress editor interface if they don't have alt text. Socially engineer your WordPress content developers to write alt text for images.

(Looking for something like this, but for Drupal? Take a look at [Carole Mah's Blur No-Alt **for Drupal** fork](https://github.com/c-e-mah/blur_no_alt).)

## Description

This plugin blurs images in the WordPress Block Editor interface if there is no alt text on the image, or if the alt text contains .jpg, .png, or .gif. **Site visitors** still see the image just fine, but **editors** will see a blurred image in the dashboard. Hovering or selecting the image removes the blur effect.

As of v0.93, this plugin can optionally blur images on the front end **only for logged-in users with the `edit_pages` capability**.

Most styles work in all "modern browsers" (not Internet Explorer). Media & Text blocks with the "crop" setting only work in very recent browsers that support the `:has()` psuedo selector.

### Note: Unblurring Decorative Images

Note: This will blur __all__ images in the editing UI that don't have alt text â€” even decorative images that should not have alt text, or images that are described elsewhere in the text. If you have such an image, you can give the img element the class `noalt` and it will not blur.

On the front-end, images that are marked with `[aria-hidden="true"]` (or are a descendent of an element with that attribute) will not be blurred.

### Settings

This plugin's settings are found in "Settings" > "Blur No-Alt" in the WordPress admin menu. The plugin provides two settings for customizing the plugin's behavior:

- Toggle the informational message about blurred images above the title in the block editor
- Toggle whether logged-in users see blurred images when viewing the front-end of the site

When the front-end styles are enabled, developers can customize which users see the blurred images with the `blur_no_alt_front_end_blur_capability` filter (default: `edit_pages`).


## Installation

To use this plugin:

1. Create a sub-directory in your `wp-content/plugins` directory called, well, you can call it anything, but how about `Blur_No-Alt`?
2. Put all of these files into it. 
3. Go into your WordPress dashboard and look at your Plugins list. Activate the plugin, and you're good to go!
4. To customize the plugin settings, go to "Settings" > "Blur No-Alt" in the admin menu.
